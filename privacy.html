                <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Basic information</strong>: When you make a purchase through the app store, you provide some personal information such as your name and email address. This information is used to record the purchase that you have made, so that if it is deleted it will be associated with your account and recoverable later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are small data files transfered to your computer or device, used to record information about website usage and other things. Our website and apps does not store any cookies on your device, and all items on this site will function with cookies disabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Transactions</strong>: All transactions within our apps are processed through the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. Both Google and Apple have access to any data you may provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Third-Parties</strong>: We do not sell, trade, or transfer any of your personal information to outside parties. We also do not include offers from any third-parties on our website or apps. All our apps are handled by either the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store, and so Google and Apple will have access to any data entered. We do not host ads on our site, and no information is given to ad services.
                </p>
                <h3>Modifying Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    If you need to change the name, email, or any other data associated with your account, you should follow the procedures outlined in the Google Play Store and iOS App Store. Doing so will ensure that you still have access to any purchases you have made.
                </p>
                <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    This policy may be revised from time to time. The most recent version of this policy will always be found here, at <a href="http://mbhs-spc.github.io/privacy">http://mbhs-spc.github.io/privacy</a>.<br>
